This repository contains a ASP.NET Core middlware for running [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) in your development environment.

# Setup

Add the middleware in your `Startup.Configure`-method.

```csharp
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    services.UseParcelBundler(new ParcelBundlerOptions("Client/index.html"));
}
```

This will start Parcel in the background with the given file as its entry point. Several entry points can be configured:

```csharp
services.UseParcelBundler(new ParcelBundlerOptions("Client/js/app.js", "Client/css/app.scss"));
```

Content will be built to the web-root of ASP.NET Core (see [`WebHost.UseWebRoot`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/web-host?view=aspnetcore-2.1#web-root)), which by default is `wwwroot`.

To build to a specific directory in your web-root you can specify the `OutDir`-option:

```csharp
services.UseParcelBundler(new ParcelBundlerOptions("Client/index.html")
{
    OutDir = "dist"
})
```

This configuration will build the content to `wwwroot/dist`.

The other possible options in `ParcelBundlerOptions` are the same as those provided by the [Parcel Bundler API](https://parceljs.org/api.html#bundler).

# Known issues

## Not reloading files

Parcel watches file system changes. Some editors uses "safe writes" which is incompatibile witch watching file system changes on some of file systems (like on Windows).
environment variable `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1` solves this problem (paid by performance). [Parcel Issue 564](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/564).

## Hot Module Reload and HTTPS

HMR does not work out-of-the-box when hosting your application under HTTPS. To make 
HMR work you will either need to use `HTTP` in ASP.NET Core or configure the middleware 
with some trusted certificate using `ParcelBundlerOptions.Https`.

The reason that HRM does not work is that the HMR-code in Parcel will look at the protocol
used by the browser when accessing your application to determine whether to use a secure
WebSocket when connecting to Parcel's dev-server. If you application is hosted using HTTPS
but Parcel is not, then it will try to connect using the wrong protocol.

**This is not an issue which can be fixed in this repository. It is an issue which needs to be
fixed in Parcel itself.**

Some ideas to make things easier, which I might propose to the maintainers of Parcel:

1) Add support for PFX-files when configuring HTTPS, to make it possible for this package
   to configure Parcel to use the same self-signed certificate used by ASP.NET Core.
2) Make the HMR-code in Parcel rely on the configuration given when starting the server,
   rather than relying on the protocol used by the browser.
